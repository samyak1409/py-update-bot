# Python Auto-Update Bot


## What the project does

This repository contains the code of a Basic Cross-platform Utility Bot which automatically checks for Python version update every time the computer boots, and downloads if available. 
Sounds cool right? ðŸ˜Ž Follow up the simple setup process to benefit this automation!


## Why the project is useful

Gets you rid of:
- Using the old Python interpreter even if the new version is out.
- Or wasting time in checking if the update is available or not again and again from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads).
